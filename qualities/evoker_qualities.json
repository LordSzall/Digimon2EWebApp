Its total **Creation Limit** is equal to its **BIT** + **Stage**. It uses this **Creation Limit** when conjuring objects.\n\nThe Digimon can take the **Conjure Objects Action**, which is 2 **Actions**. The **Conjure Objects Action** allows the user to conjure objects to any **Space** within the Digimon's **Range**, taking up 1 cubic **Space**. The total cubic **Spaces** of objects you can conjure cannot bypass your **Creation Limit**.\n\nConjured Objects can serve as cover that blocks terrain or block pathways. Objects are destroyed when hit with an **Attack** that deals **Damage**. If any Objects are destroyed, the cost of creating them is removed from your **Creation Limit**.\n\nThe user cannot take the **Conjure Objects Action** for 1 **Round** after it's been used.",
