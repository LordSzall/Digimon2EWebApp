The **TN** equals 10 + the **Damage** taken after being reduced by **Armor**.\n\n**Success**: The **Damage** is further reduced by half (after **Armor**).\n**Critical Success**: In addition, if this would reduce the **Damage** taken to 1, it instead takes 0 **Damage**.\n\nThis does not affect **Unalterable Damage**. Each time the Quality is used, the **TN** increases by 3 for any further use until the end of Combat.",
