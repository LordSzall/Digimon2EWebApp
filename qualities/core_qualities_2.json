It can dig through harder materials such as stone, ice or even some softer metals but this is now treated as **Difficult Terrain**.\n\nWhen the Digimon digs through such hard materials, it leaves a tunnel behind equal to its **Size** that other Digimon can pass through.\n\nThe Digimon's tremor-based sight now increases to its full **Range** while underground, and can even feel them while above ground up to a number of **Spaces** equal to half its **Range**.",

The Digimon can also use this type of **Movement** to move through liquids other than water, with restrictions from the GM.\n\nThe Digimon ignores any penalties to see other creatures underwater while it is also underwater. It can now **Hold its Breath** an unlimited amount of times per Combat. Outside of Combat, the Digimon can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to its **CPU**.\n\nIf the Digimon has the **NATUREWALK: WATER** Quality, the Digimon ignores all **Difficult Terrain** underwater.",

If the Digimon also possesses the **TUMBLER** Quality, it negates all **Damage** from falling.\n\nThe Digimon can use its Jump **Movement** to move in and out of **Difficult Terrain** as a **Move Action** rather than **Difficult Move** as long as it is not at half its Maximum **Wound Boxes** or fewer.",
