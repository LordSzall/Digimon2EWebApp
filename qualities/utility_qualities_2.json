The Digimon may freely manipulate natural sources of the element, as well as produce unique effects based on the element in question.\n\nWithin a number of **Spaces** equal to the Digimon's **DOS**, the Digimon may also change **Difficult Terrain** associated with the chosen element into **Basic Terrain** as 1 **Action**, or vice-versa. They may also change the positioning of the terrain to create structures and trails out of it, moving a number of cubic **Spaces** of said Element equal to double their **BIT** value.\n\nThe Digimon also completely negates any **ELEMENTAL FORCE** Attacks for any Element it has with **NATUREWALK**.",

These Effects are not affected by Qualities like **Resistant**, but a Digimon with a **NATUREWALK** element shared with the **DOMAIN CONTROL** Element can choose to ignore it.",
