Enemies the Digimon attacks will not be able to gain benefits from positive Effects. When the Digimon targets a specific Digimon with an Attack that is locked in a Clash with someone else, the Target Digimon only benefits from their own CPU for Armor. If the Digimon makes a [CLEANSE] Tagged Attack, it can choose to only reduce the duration of Positive Effects or Negative Effects.",

"description": "Whenever the Digimon makes an Attack with an Area Attack Tag and an Effect Tag, it can change the Tags of the Attack: The Attack is treated as [DAMAGE] for Enemies and [SUPPORT] for Allies, or the Effect does not affect Enemies. This can be used to turn a [SUPPORT] Attack meant for Allies into a [DAMAGE] Attack for Enemies while still providing benefits to allies.",
