The Digimon may now add 1 + double their Derived Stat (RAM, CPU, BIT or DOS) when making Skill Checks for that specific type of Skill, instead of just the Derived Stat. Some Qualities a Digimon can purchase will ask for a Skill Check using a Derived Stat, but alternatively they can use a Skill listed in brackets with pre-mentioned Derived Stat if they have the Prodigious Skill for that Skill Check. The maximum Ranks a Digimon can take in this Quality is equal to its Stage.",
