The allies must be adjacent for the Transporter to work properly. This also means it can use the Teleport Quality to bring allies out of harm’s way in reaction to an Attack.\n\nAll allies who are transported in this manner also forfeit Action on their next turn (as if Interceding). If a Digimon cannot pay the Action cost, another participating Digimon can choose to or this Quality doesn’t affect said Digimon.\n\nFinally, the Digimon’s **Teleport** distance increases by 1.",
